Employee Turnover Analytics – Professional Project Description

In this project, I developed a comprehensive analytics solution to understand and predict employee turnover within an organization. Using real-world HR data, I performed end-to-end data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model development to uncover the key factors influencing employee attrition.

The analysis included evaluating variables such as employee satisfaction, number of projects, working hours, tenure, promotions, and salary levels to identify hidden patterns and risk indicators. I built predictive models to estimate the likelihood of employee turnover, helping HR teams take proactive measures to improve retention. 

Clear visualizations, data-driven insights, and actionable recommendations were generated to support strategic workforce planning. 

This project demonstrates my ability to analyze complex datasets, build predictive models, and translate analytical findings into meaningful business decisions—core skills needed for data analytics, HR analytics, and business intelligence positions.
